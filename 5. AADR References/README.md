This directory features code (`aadr50_citation.R`) and intermediate data products to prepare a bibliography for all publications in the [AADR v50](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/allen-ancient-dna-resource-aadr-downloadable-genotypes-present-day-and-ancient-dna-data) dataset used for the analysis in this paper.

The collection and cleaning of all relevant bibtex entries requires some manual data curation steps as pointed out in `aadr50_citation.R`.
